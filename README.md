
# Flash Chat ⚡️

##  Goal

The objective  is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into our Flutter apps.  I used the Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. 


We’re going to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
